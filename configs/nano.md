# nano options

Create `/etc/nanorc` or `~/.nanorc`, if it doesn't already exist.

**Warning:** do not blindly overwrite `/etc/nanorc` if you go that route!

```shell
set autoindent
set constantshow
set indicator
set linenumbers
set minibar
set mouse
set multibuffer
set tabsize 2
```
(consider adding to root user as well, if you went the home folder route)
